# RovVisionV3

Technical planning
------------------
* automated TMUX startup with node configs (fps, zmq - msg buffer properties, inputs, outputs, optional)
* nodes describe input output formats/data in startup messages - checks
* many plugins for different sensors / actuators based on node structure - in hierarchical file structure
* configurable GUI, modularize, automate gstreamer and video stream display, configurable annotation plugins
* polish simulations, modularize
* fileviewer update
* Sensor fusion, state estimation
* control algorithms operating on state (sensors also having states to operate on directly)
* documentation - installation, simulation, messaging, config, adding plugins/assets
* file/data transfer and upload interface
* web based data service - annotations, deep learning, 2D/3D viewers and mission replay - VIAME?
* mission programs defined in vectors / conditions / text?

Business planning
-----------------
* Bay dynamics does electronics, integration, thrusters, wiring
* advertise for someone (fieldwork contractor, software developer)
* CV student projects for hiring
* logo
* links on UCvision website, more media, 3D embedded
* donations button on github or account details?
* offer money for plugins from contributers?
