# RovVisionV3

Technical planning
------------------
* automated TMUX startup with node configs (fps, zmq - msg buffer properties, inputs, outputs, optional)
* automated gstreamer and GUI video display config
* nodes describe input output formats/data in startup messages - checks
* many plugins for different sensors / actuators based on node structure - in hierarchical file structure

Business planning
-----------------
* documentation
* logo
* links on UCvision website, 
* donations button on github or account details?
* should we offer money for plugins from contributers with donations?
